# MetalLB Manifests

This folder contains only the manifests required for MetalLB controller and speaker. All other obsolete files and folders have been removed for consolidation.

- controller.yaml
- speaker.yaml
- crds.yaml

Configuration files (e.g., IP pools) are now managed in `metallb-config/`.
